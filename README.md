Testing JavaScript functions using Jasmine

Testing JavaScript functions using QUnit

JavaScript functions were created to perform certain tasks according to spec:
e.g. range(2, 5) --> [2,3,4,5] 
compute(1,2,3,4) --> [2,3] - Returns an array of the second lower and highest 
areConsecutive(numArr, allowDuplicates) - Determines whether the numbers in an array are consective

This project utilizes Jasmine to check whether the functions above works correctly.
